# Minesweeper - Open Source

This little game is a pure classic. I tried to implement it myself inside of the .NET Framework with WPF and the popular MVVM pattern. It worked pretty well so here it is!

## Features
* Three different difficulties
* Random field creation
* Mouseclick recognition

## Extensibility
The code is written highly dynmically so the project ca be extended with ease. Everything from `BoardSize` to `NumberOfMines` can be configured to your needs, so everyone can find thier own personal limits :)
